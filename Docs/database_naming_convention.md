## Database Naming Convention

While creating new tables using sequelize-cli we will have 2 naming conventions and will need to be manually updated:

- In the migrations folder tables will be in lowercase and snake case to easily query.
- In the models folder change file names and and table names to camelCase to reflect JavaSripts syntax of class.
