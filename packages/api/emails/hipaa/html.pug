  p  Hello #{name}
  p
    | A member of your medical team has recently nominated your family for a Keep Swimming Foundation
    | grant this quarter. If you are unaware of Keep Swimming Foundation and this nomination, please speak
    | with your hospital's social worker who is assigned to your family&apos;s care plan.
  p.mb3
    | Before Keep Swimming Foundation can fully process your application, a signed HIPAA Authorization
    | Form must be completed and sent to Keep Swimming Foundation as soon as possible. This form
    | authorizes the hospital at which your loved one is treatment to provide information on the patient&apos;s
    | hospitalization to Keep Swimming Foundation.

    | HOW TO AQUIRE A HIPAA AUTHORIZATION FORM:
  p
    | Every hospital has their own HIPAA Authorization Form (also known as a Release of Information Form).
    | The best way to obtain this form is to speak with your nurse, physician or the hospital&apos;s social worker.
  p
    | If the patient is 18 years of age or older, they must sign the hospital&apos;s HIPAA Authorization Form.
    | However, in some cases, if the patient is unable to sign documents, a loved one may be able to do so on
    | their behalf. Your hospital&apos;s social worker can aid you with this.
  p
    | If the patient is younger than 18 years of age, a legal guardian must sign the HIPAA Authorization Form
    | on their behalf.
  p
    span.text__bold Please Note: 
    | Due to the large volume of applications that Keep Swimming Foundation receives, we will
    | not follow-up with any nominating party regarding this step. Please understand that you are fully
    | accountable for acquiring and submitting the completed HIPAA Authorization Form in a timely fashion. To
    | submit a completed HIPAA Authorization Form, send the form to us as an 
    span.text__bold unsecured attachment 
    | at: 
    a.text__bold(href="mailto:info@keepswimmingfoundation.org") info@keepswimmingfoundation.org
    | . We do not accept any submissions via standard mail.
  p
    | If you need help with this step, please contact a social worker at your hospital.
  p
    | Keep Swimming Foundation selects recipients on a quarterly basis. In 2020, application deadlines will be:

  p
    each quarter,index in quarters
      span.text__bold Quarter #{index+1}: 
      if target === index+1
        span.text__color_blue.text__bold #{quarter} - Current Quarter and your deadline
      else
        span #{quarter}
      br
  p
    | You will be asked to provide additional information, so please make sure you act as soon as possible so
    | that you meet our provided deadlines. To give every nominee an equal chance, all deadlines are firm and
    | will not be extended.
  p
    | Lastly, please understand that this application process 
    span.text__bold does not guarantee the nominated individual/family will receive a grant from Keep Swimming Foundation. 
    | It is imperative that the
    | nominated individual/family does not rely on these funds and that the nominated individual/family
    | understands that they will only be contacted by Keep Swimming Foundation 
    span.text__bold after the nearest quarterly
    | deadline regarding the outcome of their application.
  p
    | We send our best to your loved one during this troubling time and we look forward to receiving your
    | completed HIPAA Authorization Form in the near future.
  p 
    | -Keep Swimming Foundation
